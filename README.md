This is my adaptation of [Simple ESP with screenshot cleaner](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/star-wars-battlefront-2-a/438195-simple-esp-screenshot-cleaner.html) used as a base.

Using code and logic from [Old source](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/star-wars-battlefront-2-a/381353-source.html) to improve the source.
